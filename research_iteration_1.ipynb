    "This all leads us to conclude that the HU dataset has probably been merged from 2 different datasets in at best an undocumented way, and at worst an illogical way. Combining this with the fact that there is no discernible source for the dataset, has lead us to decide that in the spirit of the scientific process with regard to transparency, we can't draw conclusions from the HU dataset in good faith. We will rephrase the questions asked to fit the review- and chemicaldataset and use those instead in the next iteration."
